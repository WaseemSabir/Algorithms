&emsp;**Divide and Conquer**<br>
&emsp;&emsp;**1. Karatsuba algorithm**<br>
&emsp;&emsp;The brute force method for multiplication of two number takes O(n^2) time whereas karatsuba algorithm can do the same task with running time of O(n^1.59). The graph compares this difference upto the input of 10000 digits.

&emsp;&emsp;**1. Longest Common Subsequence**<br>
&emsp;&emsp;The time to find lcs of two sentences can be improved to polynomial time(n^2) with bottom up approach.<br>
